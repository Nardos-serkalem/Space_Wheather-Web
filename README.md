#  SpaceWeather Website & Mobile App

 This project includes both a web and mobile application that visualizes and provides real-time data on space weather activities 
---

##  Project Overview

- **Website**: Built for researchers, scientists, and the general public to monitor and analyze space weather events(make it blue print because we dont have to give monitaization acess to others but try to put the skeleton).
- **Mobile App**: Lightweight Android/iOS application offering real-time notifications and VTEC estimations.
- **Goal**: Support solar storm forecasting and space-weather-related warnings.

##  How Interns Can Contribute

We encourage interns to take ownership of tasks, learn collaboratively, and build meaningful features. Here's how you can get started:

###  Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your forked repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spaceweather.git
   cd spaceweather
   ```

3. **Set up** your development environment:
   - For the **web app**:
     ```bash
     cd web
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - For the **mobile app** (React Native or Flutter):
     ```bash
     cd mobile
     # For React Native
     npm install
     npx react-native run-android
     ```

4. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```

###  Tasks for Interns

Here are some suggested contributions for interns:

-  UI/UX Improvements (Web and Mobile)
-  Bug Fixes
-  Real-time graph data Integration
-  Push Notification for geomagnetic Storm Alerts
